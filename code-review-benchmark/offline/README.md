# Offline Code Review Benchmark

Open replication of the code review benchmark used by companies like [Augment](https://www.augmentcode.com/blog/introducing-augment-code-review) and [Greptile](https://www.greptile.com/blog/code-review-benchmark). 50 PRs across 5 major open-source codebases with human-verified golden comments. An LLM judge evaluates each tool: does it find real issues? Does it generate noise?

Adding a new tool requires forking the benchmark PRs and collecting the tool's reviews — see Steps 0 and 1 below.

## Methodology

Each of the 50 benchmark PRs has a set of **golden comments**: real issues that a human reviewer identified, with severity labels (Low / Medium / High / Critical) and category tags (bug, security, concurrency, etc.). These are the ground truth.

For each tool, the pipeline:
1. **Extracts** individual issues from the tool's review comments (line-specific comments become candidates directly; general comments are sent to an LLM to extract distinct issues)
2. **Deduplicates** candidates — tools that post the same issue in both a summary comment and as inline comments would otherwise be penalised for the duplicate. An LLM groups candidates that express the same underlying concern; sibling duplicates are not counted as false positives in step 3.
3. **Judges** each candidate against each golden comment using an LLM: "Do these describe the same underlying issue?"
4. **Scores** using category-based profiles and F-beta to compute precision, recall, and composite scores.

The judge accepts semantic matches — different wording is fine as long as the underlying issue is the same.

### Scoring profiles

Golden comments are grouped by category. Three scoring profiles control which categories count toward the score:

| Profile | Categories | Golden Count |
|---|---|---|
| **Strict** | bug, security, concurrency, data, api | 139 |
| **Core** (default) | Strict + perf, test_gap, doc_defect | 158 |
| **All** | Core + style, speculative | 173 |

When a tool matches a golden comment whose category is *excluded* by the active profile, that match is **matched-excluded** — neither rewarded nor penalized. This prevents verbose tools from being punished for catching real-but-minor issues.

The dashboard supports F-beta scoring (β = 0.5 to 3.0). F1 weights precision and recall equally; F2 weights recall 4x more, reflecting the real-world cost asymmetry where missed bugs are worse than false alarms.

### Judge models used

Results are stored per judge model so you can compare how different judges score:
- `anthropic_claude-opus-4-5-20251101`
- `anthropic_claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`
- `openai_gpt-5.2`

## Known limitations

- **Static dataset** — PRs are from well-known repos; tools may have seen them during training (training data leakage). See [`online/`](../online/) for a benchmark that avoids this.
- **Golden comments are human-curated** but may miss edge cases or disagree with other reviewers. The golden set has sparse coverage of style/nit issues (~10 across 50 PRs), so tools that flag many correct style issues will still see some counted as false positives.
- **LLM judge introduces model-dependent variance** — different judge models may score differently. We mitigate this by using consistent prompts and reporting the judge model used.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd offline
uv sync
```

2. Create `.env` file (see `.env.example`):
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# fill in your tokens
```

## Tests

Run the pytest suite (no network access required):

```bash
pytest
```

## Linting

```bash
ruff check .
```

---

## Pipeline steps

All scripts live in the `code_review_benchmark/` package. Run from the `offline/` directory. Output goes to `results/`.

### 0. Fork PRs

Fork benchmark PRs into a GitHub org where the tool under evaluation is installed:

```bash
uv run python -m code_review_benchmark.step0_fork_prs
```

### 1. Download PR data

Aggregate PR reviews from benchmark repos with golden comments:

```bash
# Full run (incremental - skips already downloaded)
uv run python -m code_review_benchmark.step1_download_prs --output results/benchmark_data.json

# Test mode: 1 PR per tool
uv run python -m code_review_benchmark.step1_download_prs --output results/benchmark_data.json --test

# Force refetch all reviews
uv run python -m code_review_benchmark.step1_download_prs --output results/benchmark_data.json --force

# Force refetch for a specific tool
uv run python -m code_review_benchmark.step1_download_prs --output results/benchmark_data.json --force --tool copilot
```

**Output:** `results/benchmark_data.json`

### 2. Extract comments

Extract individual issues from review comments for matching:

```bash
# Extract for all tools
uv run python -m code_review_benchmark.step2_extract_comments

# Extract for specific tool
uv run python -m code_review_benchmark.step2_extract_comments --tool claude

# Limit extractions (for testing)
uv run python -m code_review_benchmark.step2_extract_comments --tool claude --limit 5
```

Line-specific comments become direct candidates. General comments are sent to the LLM to extract individual issues.

**Output:** Updates `results/benchmark_data.json` with `candidates` field per review.

### 2.5. Deduplicate candidates (recommended)

Group duplicate candidates before judging. Tools that post the same issue in
both a summary and inline comments would otherwise receive false positive
penalties for the duplicate. This step is optional but recommended — without it,
precision scores are artificially lowered for tools with overlapping comment
formats.

```bash
# Deduplicate all tools
uv run python -m code_review_benchmark.step2_5_dedup_candidates

# Deduplicate a specific tool only
uv run python -m code_review_benchmark.step2_5_dedup_candidates --tool qodo

# Force re-run (default is incremental)
uv run python -m code_review_benchmark.step2_5_dedup_candidates --force
```

**Output:** `results/{model}/dedup_groups.json`

Each entry maps `(golden_url, tool)` to a list of groups, where each group is a
list of candidate indices that express the same issue. Singletons (no duplicate)
appear as single-element groups.

### 3. Judge comments

Match candidates against golden comments, calculate precision/recall:

```bash
# Evaluate all tools (with dedup applied)
uv run python -m code_review_benchmark.step3_judge_comments \
  --dedup-groups results/{model}/dedup_groups.json

# Evaluate specific tool
uv run python -m code_review_benchmark.step3_judge_comments --tool claude

# Force re-evaluation
uv run python -m code_review_benchmark.step3_judge_comments --tool claude --force

# Run without dedup (baseline for comparison)
uv run python -m code_review_benchmark.step3_judge_comments \
  --evaluations-file results/{model}/evaluations_no_dedup.json
```

**Output:** `results/{model}/evaluations.json` with TP/FP/FN, precision, recall per review.

`--dedup-groups` — path to the dedup groups file from step 2.5. Duplicate
candidates in the same group will not be counted as false positives.

`--evaluations-file` — override the default output path, useful when running
multiple comparison variants without overwriting the baseline.

### 4. Generate dashboard

Regenerate the dashboard JSON and HTML from evaluation results:

```bash
uv run python analysis/benchmark_dashboard.py
```

**Output:** `analysis/benchmark_dashboard.json` and `analysis/benchmark_dashboard.html`

Open `analysis/benchmark_dashboard.html` in a browser to view results. The dashboard includes:
- Scoring profile selector (Strict / Core / All)
- F-beta slider (0.5–3.0) for weighting precision vs. recall
- Dimension filters (language, PR size, domain, complexity, etc.)
- Scatter plot and sortable table

Run this after adding new tools or re-running the judge to update the dashboard.

### 5. Summary table

Show review counts by tool and repo:

```bash
uv run python -m code_review_benchmark.summary_table
```

**Example output:**
```
Tool        cal_dot_com  discourse    grafana      keycloak     sentry       Total
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
claude      10           10           10           10           10           50
coderabbit  10           10           10           10           10           50
...
```

### 6. Export by tool

Export tool reviews with evaluation results:

```bash
# Export Claude (default)
uv run python -m code_review_benchmark.step4_export_by_tool

# Export specific tool
uv run python -m code_review_benchmark.step4_export_by_tool --tool greptile
```

**Output:** `results/{tool}_reviews.xlsx`

### Speed analysis

Compute review latency per tool from GitHub PR timelines:

```bash
uv run python -m code_review_benchmark.step_speed_analysis \
  --org code-review-benchmark --output results/speed_analysis.json
```

**Output:** `results/speed_analysis.json`
