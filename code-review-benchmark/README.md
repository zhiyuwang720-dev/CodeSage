Open-source [benchmark](https://codereview.withmartian.com) for evaluating AI code review tools — the datasets, the judge, and the pipeline code. Reproduce our results or evaluate your own tool.

## The problem

As AI agents write more code, we need systems to make sure the code they generate is good. This has led to the proliferation of AI code review tools.

Without shared evals for these tools, every company grades its own homework. You can't reproduce the results, compare tools on the same dataset, or verify the methodology. With static evals, agents can game the benchmark. By creating an online and offline benchmark that can check each other, this project allows for robust code review evals.

**We open-source everything**: the PRs, the golden comments, the LLM judge prompts, the evaluation pipeline, and a continuously-updated online benchmark that avoids training data leakage.

## Two benchmarks

### Offline — fixed dataset, reproducible results

**50 PRs** from 5 major open-source projects, each with human-verified golden comments — the real issues a reviewer should catch.

| Repository | Language | Domain |
|---|---|---|
| [Sentry](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry) | Python | Error tracking |
| [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana) | Go | Observability |
| [Cal.com](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com) | TypeScript | Scheduling |
| [Discourse](https://github.com/discourse/discourse) | Ruby | Forum platform |
| [Keycloak](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak) | Java | Authentication |

Each PR has curated golden comments with severity labels (Low / Medium / High / Critical). An LLM judge matches each tool's review against the golden comments and computes precision and recall.

**Tools evaluated**: Augment, Claude Code, CodeRabbit, Codex, Cursor Bugbot, Gemini, GitHub Copilot, Graphite, Greptile, Propel, Qodo, and more. Adding a new tool takes an afternoon — fork the benchmark PRs, trigger the tool, run the pipeline.

> **Known limitation**: Static datasets risk training data leakage — tools may have seen these PRs during training. That's why we also run the online benchmark.

See [`offline/README.md`](offline/README.md) for setup and usage.

### Online — continuous, fresh PRs, no data leakage

The online benchmark continuously samples **fresh real-world PRs from GitHub** where code review bots left comments. Because the PRs are recent, tools can't have memorized them during training.

```

                   PR context     matching                    time series
```

**How analysis works**:

1. **Extract bot suggestions** — The LLM reads the diff the bot reviewed and the bot's comments, then extracts each actionable suggestion with its category (bug, security, performance, style, ...) and severity.
2. **Extract human actions** — The LLM reads the post-review commits and identifies what the developer actually fixed after the bot commented.
3. **Judge matching** — The LLM determines which bot suggestions correspond to actual fixes, producing per-PR precision (what % of the bot's comments were useful?) and recall (what % of real issues did the bot catch?).

**Bots tracked**: CodeRabbit, GitHub Copilot, Claude, Cursor, Augment, Codex, Gemini, Greptile, Graphite, Qodo, Propel, and others.

**Dashboard features**: Filter by language, project domain, PR type, issue severity, diff size. Track performance over time. Adjustable F-beta weighting.

See [`online/README.md`](online/README.md) for architecture and setup.

## How the LLM judge works

Both benchmarks use an LLM-as-judge approach, but with different methodologies suited to their data:

| | Offline | Online |
|---|---|---|
| **Ground truth** | Human-curated golden comments | Developer's post-review fixes |
| **Precision** | Tool comments that match a golden comment / total tool comments | Bot suggestions matched to real fixes / total suggestions |
| **Recall** | Golden comments found by the tool / total golden comments | Real fixes caught by the bot / total fixes made |
| **Judge input** | Golden comment + tool candidate | Full PR timeline: diff, bot comments, post-review commits |

In both cases, the judge prompt asks "do these describe the same underlying issue?" — different wording is fine, only the substance matters.

**Judge model variance**: Different LLM judges can score differently. We mitigate this by storing results per judge model and reporting which model was used. The offline benchmark has been evaluated with Claude Opus 4.5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and GPT-5.2.

## Quick start

### Offline benchmark

```bash
cd offline
uv sync
cp .env.example .env               # add GitHub token + LLM API key

# Download reviews for all tools
uv run python -m code_review_benchmark.step1_download_prs --output results/benchmark_data.json

# Extract individual issues from reviews
uv run python -m code_review_benchmark.step2_extract_comments

# Deduplicate candidates (prevents false positives from inline+summary overlap)
uv run python -m code_review_benchmark.step2_5_dedup_candidates

# Run the LLM judge (pass dedup groups to avoid penalising duplicate candidates)
uv run python -m code_review_benchmark.step3_judge_comments \
  --dedup-groups results/$(MARTIAN_MODEL)/dedup_groups.json

# View results
open analysis/benchmark_dashboard.html
```

### Online benchmark

```bash
cd online/etl
uv sync
cp .env.example .env               # add GitHub token + GCP project + LLM API key

# Discover recent PRs from BigQuery
uv run python main.py discover --all --days-back 7

# Enrich with GitHub API data
uv run python main.py enrich --chatbot "coderabbitai[bot]" --one-shot

```

## Adding a new tool to the offline benchmark

1. Fork the 50 benchmark PRs into a GitHub org where your tool is installed
2. Let the tool review each PR
3. Add the tool name to the download config and run the pipeline
4. Results appear alongside existing tools in the dashboard

See [`offline/README.md`](offline/README.md) for detailed instructions.
